## The Agricultural Revolution (10,000 years ago)
The Agricultural Revolution formed the foundational stepping stone that led to full-blown human 
civilization.  This marked the widespread transition in humans’ lifestyles from nomadic hunting and 
gathering of wild animals and vegetation to the sedentary and stationary world of domesticated 
crops and livestock.  Agriculture is the way most of us get our food today -- in fact, society has 
become sufficiently specialized that most of us, including myself, never need to think about the 
source of the food we eat.  Agriculture has allowed the worldwide population to explode to billions 
of people, yet the most interesting point that Harari makes when discussing the revolution that 
made this all posible is that the revolution may have been one of the worst things that could happen 
for our quality of life.

## Evaluating our Happiness
I really like how Harari wraps up the book.  After walking through the vast history of our species, he 
spends the second to last chapter reflecting on something that is often excluded from historical 
analyses -- individual human happiness (defined generally as [subjective well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness)).  In previous 
chapters, the argument was made that the world is generaly becoming safer and more friendly to 
individual humans thanks to societal philosophies like liberalism and economic globalization.  With 
these improving circumstances, it’s intuitive to expect that on average, humans should feel happier 
today than they did thousands of years ago, when they were much more likely to be oppressed by 
an aggresive empire, forced to work long hours in exchange for subsistence survival and little 
power/recognition, or threatened by predatory animals that were positionined much higher in the 
food chain.

## Conclusion: 5 Key Takeaways
1. The big bang created the world
2. The Cognitive Revolution was fuelled by the invention and use of human language to communicate abstract ideas
3. The Agricultural Revolution in creased human population at the possible expense of individual quality of life
4. The Scientific Revolution, fuelled by imperialism and capitalism, allowed civilizations to look past the comforts of monotheistic religions and seek out new knowledge, granting us immense power and ability to manipulate our environment
5. The Industrial Revolution spawned consumerism and modern materialism
